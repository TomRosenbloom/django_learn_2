# django_learn_better

Learning Django, take two.

Use case this time around is a database of poets, their poems, and where they were published.

This time my organisation/strucutre policy for is one app per domain object. So I have an app for person, an app for person names, and an app for poets. A poet is a type of person, and persons have names.
